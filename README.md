A [Minkowski diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime_diagram) shows what would happen to
different objects as time goes by in order to understand general relativity without mathematical
equations.

Objects can be added to different reference frames and their path is shown, as well as their current
position at different times.

This way time dilation and length contraction can be easily visualized.

The grid in this visualization represents one year in the vertical axis (time), and one light-year
in the horizontal axis (space). It can also be considered one second and one light-second.

For every year passed (1 y unit), light travels one light-year (1 x unit), for all observers. This
is delimited by the light cone shown in light yellow.

## Reference frames

The essential concept of general relativity (or even Galilean relativity) are reference frames. We
are accustomed to view the world from one reference frame, but every moving (and non-moving) object
has its own reference frame.

The reality of two objects with the same velocity vector is similar. Even objects with relatively
small difference—say 10 m/s. But when the velocity differential reaches a significant amount of the
speed of light—say 50% the speed of light, then their space is drastically different.

In this program every reference frame is identified with an integer, our reference frame is 0. By
changing our speed from the controls we can see how the paths of different objects changes, since
their reference frame is different from ours.

## Lorentz transformation

The key to maintaining a constant speed of light to all observers is a Lorentz transformation. As we
rotate to match the velocity of another object we can see reality from their perspective and the
speed of light always remains constant.

With Lorentz transformations it's possible to switch between reference frames and see what would
happen to the paths of objects.

## Now

My main motivation with this program is not only to intuitively show time dilation and length
contraction in real-time—which can be seen as spacetime warps, but what happens to the notion of
**now**.

If time moves in the y direction, then movements in space can only be made orthogonally; in the x
direction.

Space is orthogonal to time, and both are shown with dotted lines for each reference frame.

But as this visualization shows; both the direction of time and space shift as the velocity of an
observer changes, therefore the conception of **the present** for every observer is different.

**The present** space of one observer can be in the future of another observer, at precisely the
same moment of time.
